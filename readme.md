# iCal.NET

## What is iCal.NET?
iCal.NET is an iCalendar (RFC 5545) class library for .NET aimed at providing RFC 5545 compliance, while providing full compatibility with popular calendaring applications and libraries.

## Mission Statement
Make ICal.NET the best in class for .NET - in terms of usability, performance and reliability (RFC compliance / compatibility).

**Join the project and help to achieve this goal!**

## Migrating from dday.ical to ical.net

There's a guide just for you: **[Migrating from dday.ical](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Migrating-from-dday.ical)**

## Examples

The wiki contains several pages of examples of common ical.net usage scenarios.

* [Simple event with a recurrence](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki)
* [Deserializing an ics file](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Deserialize-an-ics-file)
* [Working with attachments](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Working-with-attachments)
* [Working with recurring elements](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Working-with-recurring-elements)

## Versioning

ical.net uses [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/). In a nutshell:

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner, and
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes.

## Contributing

* [Submit a bug report or issue](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Filing-a-(good)-bug-report)
* [Contribute code by submitting a pull request](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/wiki/Contributing-a-(good)-pull-request). **Always open an issue first**, so we can discuss necessary changes.
* [Ask a question](https://github.com/ical-org/ical.net/discussions). **Please never use the issue tracker for questions.**

## Support

* We ask and encourage you to contribute back to the project. This is especially true if you are using the library in a commercial product.

* Questions asked in the discussion area are open to the community or experienced users to answer. Give maintainers a helping hand by answering questions whenever you can.

* Remember that keeping ical.net up is something ical.net maintainers and many contributors do in their spare time.

### Paid support

In case you need it, [Rian Stockbower may offer paid support and bugfixes](https://rianjs.net/consulting).
 A few basic rules to consider when asking for this kind of support:

* Any changes made to the ical.net library are open source, and will always be published on nuget for others to consume.
* You do not own the changes made to the library even if you paid for them.
* Congruence with the ical-org vision for the future of ical.net is required. That means we step back from things like "add Exchange interop", or take  dependencies on third-party libraries that benefit only your one or very few use cases.
